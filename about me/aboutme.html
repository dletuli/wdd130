    <h2> Dominique Jarreau Letuli </h2>
    <h3> "DJ" </h3>

    <p> Hi everyone! I'm DJ Letuli and I owe taxes as Dominique - haha. My first name comes from my Dadâ€™s favorite basketball player, nine-time NBA All-star Dominique Wilkins, and Jarreau after his favorite 80's R&B singer Al Jarreau. To answer your question, I didn't make it to the NBA, and I don't have an album out (lol), but I was a DJ. When I was born my Dad was working as a radio-DJ for the island's local radio station. Because of that, he built quite a collection of vinyl records, cassettes, and CDs which he later used to start his own DJ business. So, as you can imagine, I grew up listening to all kinds of music and with all kinds of people because we played everywhere, like church dances, birthday parties, high school events, clubs, beauty pageants, drag shows, fundraisers, parades, weddings and even funerals. </p>

    <p> I now live in Utah since moving here from American Samoa in 2006. I am currently a Production Manager with a local manufacturing company and have been working with them for 8 years. Before that I was a Youth Counselor at the Salt Lake County Juvenile Center for 7 years. I am now making my move into IT because I figured if they keep raising the retirement age, at least I'll have the option to work from home while sitting in a wheelchair. (idk - I picture myself in a wheelchair when I'm 60+.) </p>
    
    <p> I am excited to continue learning and looking forward to working with all of you. </p>
